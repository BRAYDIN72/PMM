Look, I don't even know what I am doing with half of this stuff. So no reason to read too much here

setup your docker  with each folder as a path.
/config
/templates
/metadata
/overlay
/reports
/logs
ect... past that I can only tell you that some things I managed to do were complete accidents so there is a ton of un-needed code, that problem is, I am not sure what of it is needed.
